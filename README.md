# üõçÔ∏è Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

This project is a smart NLP-based sentiment analysis tool that classifies Amazon product reviews into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** categories using a **Naive Bayes classifier** and classic text processing techniques.

Built by **Utkarsh Gupta** ‚Äî optimized for fast, reliable, and interpretable results from real-world review data.

## Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed Amazon review text
- Applied **tokenization, stopword removal, stemming**, and **TF-IDF vectorization**
- Trained with **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for high efficiency and accuracy
- Supports **real-time sentiment prediction** via a Flask web app
- Easy to deploy or extend for other review platforms (e.g., Flipkart, Myntra)

## Preprocessing Pipeline

1. Convert to lowercase and remove special characters
2. Tokenization (splitting text into words)
3. Stopword removal (e.g., "the", "is", "in")
4. Stemming using Porter Stemmer
5. TF-IDF Vectorization to extract features

- **Dataset**: Labeled Amazon product reviews
- **Train-Test Split**: 80-20
- **Accuracy**: ~85‚Äì90% on test data
- **Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score
